JCVM Travel and Tours is a Travel and Tourism  Management Website that serves as an information hub and booking website for prospective travelers planning a getaway.  Today, people travel for a range of experiences such as babymoons, staycations, voluntourism, or leisure. Our aim is to provide as much relevant information as possible to help users plan their trips. Our website is also a Business to Customer (B2C site), whose main target is the tourists and can support all the core activities of a Tourism Destination. Additionally, it is used as a perfect platform to reach our customers with important information such as itineraries, tour details, and travel destinations. With JCVM Website, it would be easier for tourists to plan their outings and book a destination ahead of time because our site contains four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update, and delete.
